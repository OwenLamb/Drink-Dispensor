Whiskey Sour machine I made when I was bored waiting for my job to start. 
The motors are a bit slow, 2 stepper motors would likely be better and faster. 
Also addding a spout that moves in and out of the way so no liquid drips would be ideal.

(not in the video) there is an ultra sonic sensor added to check if a glass has been placed.
